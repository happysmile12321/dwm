# How to use my dwm tools

To be honest,I am a newer to linux.So a lot of things,tools I just follow some youtuber.

I don't have patient to do a lot of study on different linux.

Now I am using Arch Linux,I think I will still use arch linux in the future.

So,If you are lazy,just install arch linux.I am a lazy people too,so perhaps I could not metion too much about this linux,I just recomend you to look arch wiki when you meet truble.

Here is what my ideas behind suckless and my workstation:

- dwm can leave my hand to handle some coding task.
- picom can gave me render about dwm.which make dwm more beautiful.I must have it.
- dmenu can open a program without a terminal.(somepeople use it to start script,I lazy to do that,only to let it as my start menu.)
- st is a terminal that needs a lots of patch to perfect.I have my own st build,binding some key to handle multipul task when I was coding.
- slock is a screen lock that can lock screen.(Useful when your battary is almost done.)
- above can almost do everything If you are just a simple coder.
- google-chrome-stable with plug vimium can leave my hand when I was surfing the website.
- the folder on my home directory ~/scripts restore some really usefull script.But some of them suck as wifi I can't to share.
- <del>ranger</del>(**NOT MUST**) do a little cool file explore which can more efficiently I think.I usually use it to look file,no needing to type cd.so for now,ranger's use is very less,which I think I will not hacking it in the future neither.perhaps I will delete it in the future.
- simplescreenrecoder is what I recode my screen now.I will use it in the futrue too.
- nm-applet can handle my wifi.Which I use it everyday.I don't want to typing wpa_supplicant every time as sudo.more information just watch wiki.By the way,I using the NetworkManager to manger it.
- fcitx can typing UTF-8 charactor.It is nessesary.
- dunst,which dwmblock needs,I will list all the dwmblock needs in dwmblock document.here I just metion it shortly.
- <del>flameshot</del> -gui can simply do screenshot and copy it to your clickboard,but I am now using deepin-screenrecoder,which can do screenshot and recode gif both.
- deepin-screenrecoder,do screenshot and screenrecoder.I put it's data on special directory:~/Desktop/Pictures
- LibreOffice can let me view suffix with .doc .xls .ppt,but I am not going to do ducument on linux,I will chose windows.I recomend you to do same choice with me,because windows have absolutly place on doing document.This is just for open some temp file on linux.
- neovim:my code editor.
- command line best tool:1.find 2.awk 3.sed 4.grep(these 4 things I think can done mostly script's stuff.If I or you need complete scripts,you can read gnu menual to look for them's usage.)
- bash as my shell,noting special,I like it too.
- yay as a aur tool,it automaticly,which is best.I didn't have to download and makepkg -si by myself.
- archlinux/cn:a lot of china special software that might helpfull sometime.(specially deepin-qq)
- blueberry as a front-end blue manager,is really useful.
- gimp is helpful in picture handle,which I might be stuty someday.
- openshot-qt is what I cut video which is good,other I don't try,but the mind behind these software is same.
- git as version control is really helpfull.All my suckless tools is managerd by my git.
- qq is helpful when I have to do something on computer--which as I handle text and transfor it using qq.
- ~/Desktop to restore all my work stuff.It's absolutly personal.
