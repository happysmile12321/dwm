Here perhaps won't be list for a long time.Because the main repo I think it should be a stable.

But this repo has multi branch.You can change to the snapshot branch,which I usually work there.

When I create a release commit version or a release branch,For example,I am now a web developer,If I find all best tools to develop web,so I will give that branch a name such as a web-release.
