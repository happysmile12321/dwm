| 2020-10-13 | scripts/screenshot.sh                         | define a  img save place for deepin-screenshot's clipboard.which I'd like it stay at ~/Desktop/Pictures.Do a nice job when I want to catch image,I just type Ctrl + Alt + A,and it gave me the qq screenshot's experience.Now I am fixxing a bug about deepin-screen's clipboard.I found it also can catch dynamic picture and static image.which is helpfull in frontend development. As for others,I don't care so much now. |
